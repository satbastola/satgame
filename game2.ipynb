    "# üß† How the Tic-Tac-Toe Program Works\n",
    "\n",
    "This program implements a **simple two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game** using Python. The gameplay flows in turns, with built-in checks for winning and draw conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß© Game Flow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the board**  \n",
    "   - A 3√ó3 grid filled with numbers 1‚Äì9 represents available positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Start with Player X**  \n",
    "   - `current_player` is initialized as `'X'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Game Loop**  \n",
    "   - The loop continues until a win or draw occurs.\n",
    "   - Each turn includes:\n",
    "     - Printing the board.\n",
    "     - Prompting the player for input.\n",
    "     - Validating the input.\n",
    "     - Updating the board.\n",
    "     - Checking for a win.\n",
    "     - Checking for a draw.\n",
    "     - Switching turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `print_board(board)`\n",
    "Displays the board in a visually structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `check_winner(board, player)`\n",
    "Checks:\n",
    "- Each **row**, **column**, and both **diagonals**  \n",
    "to see if all cells are the current player's symbol (`'X'` or `'O'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `is_full(board)`\n",
    "Checks if the board is full (no remaining numbers), which results in a draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéÆ Input & Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input must be a digit between `1‚Äì9`.\n",
    "- If input is invalid or position is already taken, the player is prompted again.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üèÜ End Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "- If `check_winner()` returns `True`:  \n",
    "  ‚Üí The game prints the board and announces the winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If `is_full()` returns `True` without a winner:  \n",
    "  ‚Üí The game ends in a draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîÅ Turn Switching\n",
    "\n",
    "After each valid move, `current_player` is flipped:  \n",
    "`'X'` ‚Üî `'O'`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to add enhancements like replay functionality, score tracking, or even an AI opponent? I‚Äôd love to help upgrade it.\n"
