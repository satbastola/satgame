# Jupyter Sandbox for Civil Engineering: Toward a Sustainable World

This book is a curated sandbox of nearly 75 interactive tools developed from years of classroom experience and academic exploration. Designed for undergraduate civil and environmental engineering students, it empowers learners to experiment with model sensitivity, estimate design parameters, and deepen their understanding of sustainability, water systems, geotech, and coastal engineering. Whether you're just starting out or refining your expertise, this resource invites you to explore, simulate, and design with purpose.

1. Introduction to Environmental Engineering
2. Engineering Hydrology
3. Pipe and open channel Hydraulics
4. Geotechnical Engineering and Labs
5. Ocean and Coastal Engineering
6. Sustainable Engineering

ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgments Special thanks to Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering UNO, mentors, colleagues, and students whose questions and insights inspired the structure and content of this book. Collaborative knowledge-building is the force behind every page.

ðŸŽ¯ Mission Statement: Our mission is to make complex engineering systems clear, accessible, and actionable. We believe good design begins with deep understandingâ€”and that learning should be as dynamic and applied as the challenges we aim to solve. Dive in, experiment, and discover how thoughtful engineering can shape a more sustainable world.
